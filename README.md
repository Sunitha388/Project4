Swiggyâ€™s Restaurant Recommendation 


 ### **Swiggyâ€™s Restaurant Recommendation System**  

This project is a **Streamlit-based restaurant recommendation system** designed to suggest restaurants based on user preferences like **location, cuisine, rating, and price**. It utilizes **machine learning techniques**, including **cosine similarity** for direct feature-based recommendations and **K-Means clustering** to group similar restaurants for more diverse suggestions.  

### **Key Features:**  
âœ… **Personalized Recommendations** â€“ Users can filter by city, cuisine, minimum rating, and budget.  
âœ… **Hybrid Approach** â€“ Uses both **cosine similarity** and **K-Means clustering** for better accuracy.  
âœ… **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Built with **Streamlit** for easy navigation.  
âœ… **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handles missing values intelligently to improve data quality.  

### **Technologies Used:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
ðŸ”¹ **Streamlit** (for web interface)  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Cosine Similarity, K-Means Clustering)  

This repository provides the full code along with dataset preprocessing and recommendation logic to enhance Swiggyâ€™s restaurant search experience. ðŸš€
